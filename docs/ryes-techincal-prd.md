## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
To create the most effective and personalized wake-up experience on iOS, combining cutting-edge AI voice technology with scientifically-backed awakening methods.

### Problem Statement
Traditional alarm apps fail to effectively wake users, with 57% of people hitting snooze multiple times and 23% sleeping through alarms entirely. Current solutions lack personalization, engagement, and integration with users' daily routines.

### Solution
Ryes addresses these issues through:
1. Personalized AI-generated wake-up messages
2. Engaging dismissal challenges that ensure cognitive activation
3. Intelligent scheduling based on sleep patterns and calendar events
4. Reliable alarm triggering that overcomes iOS limitations
